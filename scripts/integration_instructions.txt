1. Add this line to your sensor_module.html (BEFORE your existing gallery script):
   <script src="../scripts/custom_images.js"></script>

2. Remove or comment out the old sensorGalleries object in your HTML

3. Your gallery will now have these products:
   • sensarray: 2 images

4. Update your HTML gallery sections to match these names:
   • sensarray (from Sensarray-micro folder)
